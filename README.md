## Introduction

Welcome to my public repository that contains my C# solutions to various LeetCode problems. In this repository, I share my coding journey as I tackle interesting challenges and improve my C# programming skills.

### About LeetCode

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is a popular platform that offers a wide range of coding problems to help you prepare for technical interviews and improve your algorithmic and problem-solving skills.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on different problems. Each folder contains the C# solutions for the corresponding problems. Here's an overview of the structure:

- `LC_1310/`: Solutions for problem #1310.
- `LC_450/`: Solutions for problem #450.

However, solving enough problems I'll restructure it based on different categories. Like:
- `LinkedList/`: Solutions for linked list problems.
- `Arrays/`: Solutions for array problems.
